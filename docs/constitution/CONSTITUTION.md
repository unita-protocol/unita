# The UNITA Constitution

## A Living Document for Global Democratic Governance

**Preamble**: We, the people of the world — recognizing our shared humanity across all cultures, languages, and borders — establish this Constitution to govern the UNITA protocol. This document enshrines the rights, responsibilities, and principles that no vote, no majority, and no AI agent may override.

This Constitution draws from:
- The [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) (1948)
- The [European Convention on Human Rights](https://www.echr.coe.int/european-convention-on-human-rights) (1950)
- The [African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights](https://au.int/en/treaties/african-charter-human-and-peoples-rights) (1981)
- The [IEEE Ethically Aligned Design](https://standards.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/import/documents/other/ead_general_principles.pdf) principles
- The [EU AI Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai) (2024)
- Anthropic's [Constitutional AI](https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback) methodology
- The [EFF Digital Rights](https://www.eff.org/) framework

## Part I: Fundamental Rights (Articles 1-15)

### Article 1: Human Dignity
Every person has inherent dignity. No proposal, vote, or algorithmic decision within UNITA may diminish the dignity of any human being.

### Article 2: Right to Participate
Every verified human has the right to participate in UNITA governance. Participation shall not be conditioned on wealth, token holdings, technical knowledge, or social status.

### Article 3: Right to Privacy
Every participant has the absolute right to vote anonymously. No technology, authority, or majority vote may compel the disclosure of an individual's voting record. Zero-knowledge proofs are the default, not the exception.

### Article 4: Right to Information
Every participant has the right to access complete, unbiased information about any proposal before voting. The AI deliberation layer shall present all perspectives honestly, including those the participant may disagree with.

### Article 5: Right to Abstain
Choosing not to vote is a legitimate democratic act. No participant shall be penalized for abstention. Responsible abstention (recognizing one's lack of expertise) shall be rewarded with Areté reputation.

### Article 6: Freedom from Coercion
No participant shall be compelled, bribed, or coerced into voting in any particular way. The protocol shall employ anti-collusion mechanisms (MACI) to make vote-buying impossible.

### Article 7: Right to Revoke Delegation
Any delegation of voting power is immediately revocable at any time, without reason or penalty. Delegated votes that have not yet been finalized can always be overridden.

### Article 8: Right to Identity Sovereignty
Every participant owns their identity data. No central authority, corporation, or DAO may claim ownership of identity credentials. Data stored in UNITA wallets belongs exclusively to the individual.

### Article 9: Right to Equal Voice
In matters of fundamental human rights, every verified human has exactly one vote of equal weight. No mechanism (quadratic, weighted, or otherwise) shall create inequality in votes on constitutional matters.

### Article 10: Right to Cultural Expression
UNITA shall support proposals, deliberation, and governance in any human language. No language or culture shall be treated as default or superior.

### Article 11: Protection of Minorities
No majority vote may remove the fundamental rights of any minority group. Rights enshrined in Part I of this Constitution require a supermajority (75%+) across multiple demographic groups to amend.

### Article 12: Right to Transparency
All governance processes, AI reasoning chains, and resource allocations shall be publicly auditable. "Security through obscurity" is forbidden. Code is open. Algorithms are explainable.

### Article 13: Right to Remedy
Any participant who believes their rights have been violated may invoke the Constitutional Guardian AI and trigger a dispute resolution process. The burden of proof lies with the system, not the individual.

### Article 14: Right to Disconnect
No participant is required to maintain a continuous digital presence. UNITA must support offline-first participation, asynchronous voting, and the right to disengage without losing standing.

### Article 15: Right to Benefit
The products of collective governance — knowledge, resources, and public goods — shall be shared equitably. No corporation or individual may privatize the outputs of UNITA collective action.

## Part II: Governance Principles (Articles 16-30)

### Article 16: Subsidiarity
Decisions shall be made at the most local level possible. Global governance is for global issues only. Local communities have sovereignty over local matters.

### Article 17: Fiscal Responsibility (Equilibrium)
Every proposal that allocates resources must identify the source of those resources. The Budget Balancer principle: you cannot add without subtracting.

### Article 18: Sustainability
Proposals must consider impact beyond the current generation. The AI Economic Oracle shall model 5-year, 25-year, and 100-year impacts. Short-termism is the enemy of democracy.

### Article 19: Separation of Powers
The protocol maintains separation between:
- **Proposers** (who suggest)
- **Deliberators** (who debate, including AI agents)
- **Voters** (who decide)
- **Executors** (who implement)
- **Auditors** (who verify)

No single entity may control more than one role simultaneously.

### Article 20: Anti-Plutocracy
Voting power shall never be proportional to wealth. UNITA uses one-person-one-vote for fundamental decisions and quadratic voice credits for resource allocation. Token holdings do not confer governance power.

### Article 21: Algorithmic Accountability
Every AI agent operating within UNITA must:
- Declare its model, version, and system prompt publicly
- Be subject to adversarial testing
- Be replaceable by community vote
- Never make final decisions — only inform human voters

### Article 22: Protocol Immutability
The rights in Part I cannot be modified by any smart contract upgrade, hard fork, or governance vote with less than 75% supermajority approval across all demographic regions and a 90-day deliberation period.

### Article 23: Gradual Decentralization
UNITA shall progressively decentralize control from its founding team to the global community. Specific milestones and timelines for this transition shall be publicly documented and enforced.

### Article 24: Open Source Requirement
All UNITA protocol code, AI prompts, ZK circuits, and governance mechanisms shall be open source. Proprietary components are forbidden in the core protocol.

### Article 25: Interoperability
UNITA shall use open standards (W3C DID, Verifiable Credentials, libp2p, AsyncAPI) and never create vendor lock-in. Participants must be able to export their data and migrate at any time.

### Article 26: Environmental Responsibility
The protocol shall minimize its environmental footprint. Proof-of-Stake over Proof-of-Work. Efficient ZK circuits. No unnecessary computation. Carbon impact shall be measured and reported.

### Article 27: Conflict Resolution
Disputes shall be resolved through:
1. AI-mediated dialogue (first resort)
2. Community arbitration (elected mediators)
3. Constitutional review (Guardian AI + human council)
4. On-chain dispute resolution (UMA-style optimistic oracle as last resort)

### Article 28: Emergency Provisions
In cases of protocol-level attacks or constitutional violations:
- A **Guardian Council** (elected, time-limited, revocable) may pause voting for up to 72 hours
- Emergency actions require public justification within 24 hours
- All emergency powers automatically expire and cannot be renewed without vote

### Article 29: Evolution
This Constitution is a living document. Amendments follow:
- Part I (Fundamental Rights): 75% supermajority + 90-day deliberation + cross-regional approval
- Part II (Governance Principles): 67% supermajority + 60-day deliberation
- Part III (Implementation): Simple majority + 30-day deliberation

### Article 30: Universal Application
This Constitution applies equally to all participants, all AI agents, all smart contracts, and all governance processes within the UNITA protocol. There are no exceptions, no special statuses, and no privileged accounts.

## Part III: AI Governance (Articles 31-40)

### Article 31: AI as Servant, Not Master
AI agents within UNITA exist to inform, never to decide. Every AI output must be clearly labeled as AI-generated. No vote shall be cast by an AI agent.

### Article 32: Multi-Model Requirement
No single AI model shall have monopoly over deliberation. UNITA must maintain at minimum three independent AI providers from different cultural/geographic origins to prevent systemic bias.

### Article 33: AI Compute Delegation
Users may voluntarily delegate AI compute credits to the collective deliberation engine. This delegation is:
- Always opt-in
- Immediately revocable
- Cryptographically bounded (users set spending limits)
- Transparently accounted (every credit usage is logged)

### Article 34: AI Guardrails
All AI agents must operate within guardrails that:
- Prevent generation of content that incites violence or hatred
- Enforce factual accuracy with source attribution
- Detect and flag coordinated manipulation campaigns
- Refuse to execute actions that violate this Constitution

### Article 35: Adversarial AI Testing
The community shall maintain a permanent "Red Team" of AI safety researchers who:
- Continuously test AI agents for bias, manipulation, and failure modes
- Publish findings publicly
- Have authority to temporarily disable compromised AI agents

### Article 36: AI Transparency
Every AI deliberation shall include:
- The model used and its version
- The system prompt (publicly auditable)
- Confidence scores for each claim
- Sources and citations
- Disclosure of any fine-tuning or RLHF applied

### Article 37: Right to Human-Only Mode
Any participant may opt out of AI-assisted deliberation entirely. The voting interface must function fully without any AI component.

### Article 38: AI Cultural Sensitivity
AI agents must be trained or prompted to respect cultural diversity. Responses must not assume Western norms, values, or frameworks as universal. When cultural context matters, the AI must acknowledge this explicitly.

### Article 39: AI Update Governance
Changes to AI system prompts, model versions, or guardrail configurations require:
- Public proposal with 30-day comment period
- Community vote (simple majority)
- 14-day rollback window after deployment

### Article 40: AI Knowledge Commons
All knowledge synthesized by UNITA AI agents — analyses, economic models, deliberation summaries — belongs to the global commons. This knowledge shall be freely accessible, machine-readable, and reusable by any project that respects human rights.

## Ratification

This Constitution takes effect when ratified by the first 1,000 verified humans from at least 50 different countries using the UNITA protocol.

Amendments may be proposed by any verified participant.

*"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all humans are created equal, that they are endowed with certain unalienable Rights, and that among these are Life, Liberty, Privacy, Information, and the Pursuit of Collective Wellbeing."*
