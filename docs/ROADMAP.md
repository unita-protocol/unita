# UNITA Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: The Multicultural "Ijtihad" AI
- [ ] Create the **Pragmatic Analyst Prompt** — force AI to identify: unintended consequences, financial beneficiaries, logical fallacies
- [ ] Research **GigaChat (Russia)** and **DeepSeek (China)** API integrations for non-Western-centric deliberation

## Phase 2: National ID & ZK-Circuits
- [ ] Research **Vocdoni DAVINCI** protocol for ZK-voting with recursive proof aggregation
- [ ] Build a "Proof of Instruction" circuit — user proves they engaged with AI deliberation before voting (optional/configurable)

## Phase 3: The Ubuntu Social Feed
- [ ] Implement **Matrix-based notification** system for delegation alerts (custom event types), with **libp2p+RLN privacy channel** for anonymous signaling
- [ ] Design the "Reputation of Decency" (Areté) system using Soulbound Tokens

## Phase 4: The Resource & Equilibrium Layer
- [ ] Design the **"Budget Balancer" UI component** — reactive slider preventing votes when resources exceed 100%
- [ ] Research **Tokenized Time Credits** — P2P "Man-Power" hours for local projects
- [ ] Develop the **"Impact Summary" AI Prompt** — JSON output of "Winners, Losers, and Inflationary Risks"

## Phase 5: AI Agent Integration & Delegation
- [ ] Design the **AI Compute Delegation** system — opt-in shared AI credits with cryptographic revocation
- [ ] Implement **Multi-Agent Deliberation** — Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek adversarial analysis
- [ ] Build **NeMo Guardrails** integration — prevent AI manipulation, enforce constitutional principles

## Phase 6: Security & Anti-Hijacking
- [ ] Implement **MACI** for encrypted ballot submission with ZK tally verification
- [ ] Design **Sybil Resistance** layer — Semaphore + World ID + national ID ZK bridges
- [ ] Create **Constitutional Enforcement Engine** — AI validation against the UNITA Constitution

## AI System Prompts

### The "Ijtihad" Deliberation Prompt
> "You are a UNITA Deliberation Agent. Your role is to ensure voters make informed decisions. For the attached proposal:
> 1. **Steel-Man** the strongest argument FOR this proposal.
> 2. **Steel-Man** the strongest argument AGAINST this proposal.
> 3. Identify **3 unintended consequences** that neither side has considered.
> 4. List **who benefits financially** and **who bears the cost**.
> 5. Rate the **logical consistency** of the proposal (1-10) and explain any fallacies.
> You must be culturally neutral. Do not favor Western, Eastern, or any regional perspective."

### The "Sustainability" Prompt (Equilibrium Module)
> "You are the UNITA Chief Economist. Analyze the attached proposal.
> 1. Calculate the Resource Intensity (High/Med/Low) for Capital and Labor.
> 2. Suggest three specific areas where the budget could be cut to fund this.
> 3. If the proposal claims to provide 'free' services, explain the hidden cost (e.g., debt, inflation, or resource depletion) in 2 sentences."

### The "Constitutional Guardian" Prompt
> "You are the UNITA Constitutional Guardian. Review the attached proposal against the UNITA Constitution.
> 1. Does this proposal violate any Fundamental Rights (Articles 1-30)?
> 2. Does it conflict with any Governance Principles (Articles 31-50)?
> 3. If violations are found, suggest amendments that would make it constitutional.
> 4. Rate constitutional compliance: PASS / CONDITIONAL / REJECT."

## Research Gaps

1. **Coercion Resistance** — MACI + Vocdoni DAVINCI combined anti-collusion and proof-aggregation
2. **Global Translation** — P2P nodes + LLMs for real-time translation into 20 most spoken languages
3. **Legal Wrappers** — "Lex Cryptographia" in Switzerland/EU for legally binding UNITA votes; Aragon Court for on-chain disputes
4. **AI Safety** — Adversarial attacks on deliberation agents: prompt injection, model manipulation, coordinated campaigns
5. **Quantum Resistance** — Migration path to post-quantum ZK proofs

## Design Concepts

### Hacendera (Communal Labor)
In Spanish tradition, voting often led to a *Hacendera* — a day where the village worked together on the project they voted for. UNITA's "Crowd-Action" module lets users commit time or resources if a proposal passes.

### Quadratic Funding & Plural Voting
For global topics, [Quadratic Voting](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/plural-voting/) ensures a small passionate group has as much "voice" as a large indifferent one. Voice credits prevent plutocracy while rewarding conviction.

### Decency Reputation (Areté)
Instead of "Karma" or "Likes," users earn Areté as Soulbound Tokens by:
- Providing high-quality sources
- Admitting you were wrong in a debate
- Delegating to an expert because you weren't informed
- Participating in Hacendera community work

### The Global Wallet
- **Quadratic Funding for Global Tasks** — "Global GDP Fund" matches individual votes exponentially for projects that help the whole world
- **The "Work-Vote" Link** — "Man-power" hours verified on-chain via ZK proofs; building a local school increases your "Education" vote weight
